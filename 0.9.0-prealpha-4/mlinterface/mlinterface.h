#ifndef MLINTERFACE_H

// "Main Loop Interface" class
//
// Does more or less what it says, and provides hooks into functionality that
// openrs_main needs. It also does a huge chunk of interfacing to OS-specific
// calls in subclasses, which are automatically linked in (in the .cpp) as
// appropriate.
//
// JOBS:
//  - Interface to window creation routines
//  - Interface to OS events, which in Windows is tied to the window creation
//    routine to a large degree
//      - Possible TODO: put OS event handling in the dispatcher / event
//        handler's directory?
//  - Interface to rendering / drawing routines, which is supposed to be
//    implemented in the graphics directory but currently isn't going there
//      - TODO: move all drawing to the graphics directory, link into here
//        with a pointer or somesuch

#include <memory>

// Declaration of the entry point to OpenRS.
//
// The subclasses of MLInterface are where the true entry points are, but those
// are expected to only do OS-specific thing to set up for the intended entry
// point, and then call it.
