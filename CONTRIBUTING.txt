CONTRIBUTING:

There's usually good ways to contribute. Let me think of the list
of things that needs to be done ... I know I've got a decent list
in some of my older commits as "plans".

My overall goal is to rely on zero libraries if at all possible.
LibPNG is out. SDL, GLFW, and GLEW are out. An allowance is made for
Boost only, and even then I am sticking to header-only. I'm doing this
because I enjoy the challenge, and because it should make jumping in
and building a bit more straightforward, albeit a bit more challenging.

Needed:
 - Implement INFLATE; it should go in a .cpp besides pngloader.cpp
 - Implement an Image class
 - Finish implementing PngLoader; this will need Image and INFLATE
 - OpenGL capability, which will need PngLoader for textures
 - Menu capability
 - Finish the component entity system (this should probably be left to me)
 - Test the Dispatcher
 - Transition current, bacis system code for movement to use Dispatcher
 - Quarantining platform-dependent code
   - This is mostly kept in GLFunctionFinder, main, and utility.h.
     Although fairly soon, I intend to do directory listing with Windows
     API calls, so the directory searcher will probably end up on this
     list.

At this point, I'm pretty easy. I'll probably be stoked if you care
enough to get involved. Clone my repo, do some stuff, and send a
pull request; we'll see how it goes.

Do refer to the CODING_STYLE document. I will probably critique your
code. Nothing is meant by it, other than it's good enough for me to
want to see improved so I can merge it.
